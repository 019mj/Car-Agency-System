# Car Agency System
this is an implementaion for an application of a car agency.
This agency contains different kinds of cars. Each client gives an order to buy a car.

To achive this system, I've used my enhanced data structures such as Stacks, Queues, LinkedLists (Single and Double)

Here are some screenshots from the system:
